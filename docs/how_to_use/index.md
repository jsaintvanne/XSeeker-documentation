# Introduction

When you start XSeeker application, you should already have your different files with your peakpicking done and CAMERA also done on it.

These files will be loaded in your application, with a database if you want to annotate them against somethig.

???+ warning
	With no database loaded, you can't search for an annotation in XSeeker

On Galaxy, the `XSeeker preparator` tool makes it for you and locally you will need to process this previous tool and add it to your `inputs` folder in your XSeeker folder. 

XSeeker will allow you to annotate your different cluster searching for the best matching in the database and calculating a score. You will obtain a nort/south plot of their spectra (theoric and real) with the compound that XSeeker found for your cluster.
